# REST Country API 
This is my solution for the "REST Country API" challenge of Frontend Mentor.

What I like about Frontend Mentor is that they give you some details about what they like to see and sometimes some images but that's about it.
You're not given a solution so it's all on you to try and recreate the project as accurately as possible.

In this challenge I learned about how to use React Router and filters & maps in depth. I also build a few custom hooks, Dark Mode functionality and a controlled search bar. This challenge was loads of fun!
